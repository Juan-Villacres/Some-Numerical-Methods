# Some-Numerical-Methods
Here are some of the scripts that I used when teaching Numerical Methods. You can find my Numerical Methods Course here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUWBAm0zxJHXA-_OSQp3Cyj9r3KhoRLFy 

1) Heat-Equation-Implicit: Simulate the heat distribution by means of solving the partial differential equation of heat using the implicit finite differences method.
2) Laplace-Equation: Simulate the heat distribution when the system has reach equilibrium.
3) rk2rk4lsode: Implement the Runge-Kutta method of orders two and four in order to solve ordinary differential equations. Also, the Octave command lsode is used in order to compare methods.
4) WaveEquation (2D): Simulates the two-dimension wave equation. This is a partial differential equation solved by means of finite difference method. This script is based on an existing one.
5) Three-Body-Problem: A two-dimension version of the three body problem is solved as is proposed in 'Quarteroni, A., Saleri, F., & Gervasio, P. (2006). Scientific computing with MATLAB and Octave (Vol. 3). Berlin: Springer.'
